#Getting and Cleaning Data Week 3 Assignment


##Objective
======================================

This is a project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Assignment.

In this project , we were tasked to create tidy data from Samsung wearable computing data set.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

##Content
=====================================

This project consist of the following files  

*Readme.md 
*run_analysis.R --> The R script  that read in the relevant data files and produce a tidy data set as output. Please note that the read.table file  name are in
absolute directory. This is for convenience of processing without having to upload all the data files to github which take up a long time and waste of bandwidth.
If wanted to run the script, please change the directory to point to the location of the resident system.  
*tidydata.txt   --> The output tidydata set
